            <h2>Why Exercise?</h2>
            <p>At this point in the month, I am sincerely hoping, that you haven't broken your New Year's Resolution, and stopped exercising or vanquished your trainer and coach with “why” questions. Does this situation sound familiar? If so, keep reading.</p>
            <p>Webster's Dictionary defines fitness as the condition to being fit; suitability, appropriateness, healthiness, etc. But what does that really mean? Apparently most people are unaware or lacking the basic concepts of physical fitness. Therefore, I intend to inform you of the health problems linked with a sedentary lifestyle, why you should be physically active, the amount of exercise required to see health benefits from exercise, the goals of a healthy lifestyle, and the life lessons participating in physical fitness teaches us.</p>
